# SCRIPTS #
# for AMD module loading at the client side I use requireJS.
# This requires some work for libraries to work with the system.
# jQuery: simply load the environment and return the $
# jQuery-UI: There is a special jQuery-UI converter to work with AMD modules
#  --> https://github.com/jrburke/jqueryui-amd
# If you wish to use an new version of jQuery-UI: install it over libs/jquery-ui
# and run next command from within ./scripts/
#  >  node libs/jqueryui-amd/example/r.js libs/jqueryui-amd/convert.js libs/jquery-ui/development-bundle/ libs/jquery-ui/jquery-ui-require

#
#  JSTREE
#  I hacked the jstree library by adding an additional parameter to the move_node and rename_node
#  functions that determines whether the moving was done by a user taking a node and moving it
#  (or by entering a new name) or if it was done simply by programmatically executing 
#  the move_node/create_node function on the tree.
#
#  We needed to be able to distinguish these 2 type of actions, because otherwise there is an
#  endless loop of the client instucting the server to change name, then again the client and
#  then again the server and so on.
#
#  SlickGrid
#  SlickGrid is used for the Editor part.
